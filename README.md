Part of my Professional ePortfolio.

This Artifact demonstrates converting a C++ program to a Java program, while adding complexities. 
Project was made in Eclipse. 

This program will allow a user to login. Logins are as follows (omit quotes)
> Username: "snhuEhick" Password: 4255

> Username: "HappyClouds" Password: 200

> Username: "unknown person" Password: 0

This program features various validation. At this point in the program, passwords could only be int only. Infact, the majority of the input, besides the username, was int only. Input was validated to prevent integer overflow, make sure ints were within expected range, and validate datatypes. Input was also validated to prevent out of bounds errors when users were selecting a client from the array. Once a valid username and password is presented, the user can display the list of clients, or change a clients investment choice (either brokerage or retirement.)

Context of the original C++ program can be found within the Original Artifacts Folder

Was made in Eclipse Java IDE

# Original Document Explanation

### Project One
I was given the Object File "Project1.o" and no other documentation. This assignment was disassemble the object file, document its functionality, then recreate it into a C++ file (which are also found within that directory.)

### Project Two
This project was take the project one program, and add security fixes and document them.
